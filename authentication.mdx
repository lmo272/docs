# Authentication

To use the Lynks AI External API, you need to authenticate your requests. The authentication method depends on your subscription level.

## API Keys

There are two types of API keys you may need to use:

1. **Lynks API Key**: Required for all users
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Required for certain subscription levels

### Lynks API Key

All users must include the Lynks API Key in their requests. This key is provided when you sign up for the Lynks AI service.

To use the Lynks API Key, include it in the `X-Api-Key` header of your HTTP requests:


```http
X-Api-Key: your_lynks_api_key_here
```

### OpenAI API Key

Depending on your subscription level, you may also need to provide an OpenAI API Key. This key is used for advanced AI-powered features.

If required, include the OpenAI API Key in the `X-OpenAI-Key` header of your HTTP requests:


```http
X-OpenAI-Key: your_openai_api_key_here
```


<Note>
  If you're unsure whether you need to provide an OpenAI API Key, please check your subscription details or contact our support team.
</Note>

## Obtaining an OpenAI API Key

If your subscription requires an OpenAI API Key, follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Go to the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2. Once logged in, navigate to the API section of your account.
3. Create a new API key. Make sure to save this key securely, as it won't be shown again.
4. Use this key in your requests to the Lynks AI External API as described above.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys confidential. Do not share them publicly or include them in client-side code. Always use server-side requests to protect your keys.
</Warning>

## Example Request

Here's an example of how to include both API keys in a curl request:


```bash
curl -X POST 'https://lynks-ai-production.up.railway.app/api/tasks/optimization/name' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: your_lynks_api_key_here' \
-H 'X-OpenAI-Key: your_openai_api_key_here' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"product_name": "Example Product"}'
```


Replace `your_lynks_api_key_here` and `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.
